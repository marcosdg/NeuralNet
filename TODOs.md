General Structure
-----------------

1. Add functionality to test the network performance
   over the test set.
2. Make a 'Logger' class which will report the results
   of the learning process.
3. NeuralNet class (main) which will serve as interface
   to the user.

Metrics reported
---------------

1. Number of epochs trained.
2. Max/Min/Avg error on training set.
3. Max/Min/Avg error on test set.
4. Overfit (generalization loss)
5. Weight Matrix of the best network obtained.
      same format as the configuration file
      for the network specification.
