This document is an example on how early-stop criteria works to guarantee
us that, at the end of the learning process, we end up with the best
network obtained during learning.

GL: generalization loss
*: measure early stop.

init: net0, best_net <- net0.copy(), GL = 9999, strip-length = 1

epoch
0.	forward/backward on net0 ---> net1
*1.	forward/backward on net1 ---> net2 
		
		GL on net2 = 3, best_net <- net2.copy()

2.	forward/backward on net2 ---> net3
*3.	forward/backward on net3 ---> net4

		GL on net4 = 3.5, instead of saving it we revert changes
		setNeuralNetwork(best_net);
		^
		|
		|------ net0, net1, ..., net4 are different states of
			the same object reference, so here we are modifying
			the original instance of the network

4.	forward/backward on best_net(net2_copy)
