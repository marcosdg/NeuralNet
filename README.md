#NeuralNet

This program was implemented for an academic class project in Artificial Intelligence.

The _goal_  was to implement a program capable of loading data files from [PROBEN1](ftp://ftp.ira.uka.de/pub/neuron/) 
suite and load them into a _Neural Network_ to measure its performance. The learning algorithm
suggested was the 'classic' _"BackPropagation with momentum"_, together with _Early Stopping_
to prevent the net from over-fitting the data.

At [PROBEN1](ftp://ftp.ira.uka.de/pub/neuron/) you can find the data files and the original
documentation about PROBEN1, which includes the details about Early Stopping.
