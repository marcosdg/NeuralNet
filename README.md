#NeuralNet

This program was implemented for an academic class project in Artificial Intelligence.

The **goal**  was to implement a program capable of loading data files from PROBEN1 Benchmark
suite and load them into a **Neural Network** to measure its performance. The learning algorithm
suggested was the 'classic' **"BackPropagation with momentum"**, together with **Early Stopping**
to prevent the net from over-fitting the data.

At ftp://ftp.ira.uka.de/pub/neuron/ you can find the data files and the original documentation about PROBEN1, 
which also includes the details about Early Stopping.
